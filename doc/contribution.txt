1) Set up the project structure and GitHub repository, including configuration for version control, issue tracking, and collaboration workflows.  
2) Contributed to designing the grammar (⁠ mlang.g4 ⁠) by adding support for custom syntax, including logical operators, comparison operators, and control structures.  
3) Designed and implemented core language features, including boolean logic, comparison operators, and arithmetic operations, ensuring Python-like behavior.
4) Developed a JUnit-like testing script in MLang to validate language features with clear pass (✅) and fail (❌) outputs.
