# M-Lang 
**M-Lang** is a simple yet expressive programming language inspired by the art of cinematic storytelling. Designed to resemble the experience of writing a screenplay, M-Lang brings a creative and theatrical flair to traditional coding.

The language was developed using **ANTLR** for the lexer and parser components, while **Python** powers the interpreter, ensuring both flexibility and functionality.

M-Lang supports a wide range of fundamental programming features, including:
- Variable declarations
- Arithmetic expressions
- Print statements
- Control flow mechanisms

What sets it apart is its **narrative-driven syntax**, allowing programmers to craft logic in a format that reads like a script. This blend of storytelling and programming makes M-Lang an engaging tool for anyone looking to explore coding through a more imaginative and culturally rich lens.

## Project Structure: `mlang/`

This project is implemented in Python and is structured to support parsing and interpreting a custom programming language using ANTLR.

### Root Directory

| File/Folder        | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `main.py`          | Entry point of the project; contains the main execution logic. |
| `readme.md`        | Project documentation including usage and purpose. |
| `requirements.txt` | Lists required Python packages for the project. |
| `data/`            | Contains example inputs and related visualizations. |
| `src/`             | Contains all source code, grammar, and interpreter logic. |
| `__pycache__/`     | Auto-generated Python bytecode cache. |
| `.git/`            | Git version control metadata. |
| `.gitignore`       | Specifies untracked files to be ignored by Git. |

### `src/` — Source Code

| File/Folder              | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `main.py`                | Secondary entry script, likely used for testing or modular execution. |
| `mlang.g4`               | Grammar definition file for ANTLR. |
| `mlangLexer.py`          | Lexer generated by ANTLR. |
| `mlangParser.py`         | Parser generated by ANTLR. |
| `mlangVisitor.py`        | Visitor class for AST traversal. |
| `mlangListener.py`       | Listener class generated by ANTLR. |
| `mlangInterpreter.py`    | Main interpreter implementing the semantics of the language. |
| `antlr-4.13.0-complete.jar` | ANTLR tool used for code generation. |
| `data/trees/sampletree.png` | Visualization of a parse tree. |
| `__init__.py`            | Makes the directory a Python package. |
| `__pycache__/`           | Python bytecode cache directory. |

### `data/` — Example Input

| File                    | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `sample.mlang`           | Sample program written in M-Lang. |
| `trees/sampletree.png`   | Parse tree visualization (also found in `src/data/`). |

## Setup and Installation

Install the ANTLR runtime and necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install antlr4-python3-runtime pydot
```

### Linux (Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install default-jre python3-pip -y
pip install antlr4-python3-runtime
```

### Windows (via WSL)

```bash
wsl --install
# Then inside Ubuntu terminal:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install graphviz
sudo apt install default-jre python3-pip -y
pip install antlr4-python3-runtime
```

### MacOS (requires Homebrew)

```bash
brew install openjdk python3 graphviz
pip3 install antlr4-python3-runtime pydot
```

## Compilation Instructions

Navigate to the `src/` directory:

```bash
cd src
```

Generate the Lexer, Parser, Listener, and Visitor:

```bash
java -Xmx500M -cp ".:antlr-4.13.0-complete.jar" org.antlr.v4.Tool -Dlanguage=Python3 -visitor -listener mlang.g4
```

This generates the following files:

1. `mlangLexer.py`  
2. `mlangParser.py`  
3. `mlangVisitor.py`  
4. `mlangListener.py`

##  Running a Program

```bash
cd src
python3 main.py ../data/sample.mlang
```
